# GeoGuess Guide

Geoguess is a free game. Players compete how close the player can guess random locations in five rounds. 
You can play multiplayer with your friends. The first player creates a room and decides the room size. Other players type the same room name as the first player created and the game will start.

This game was forked from [GeoGuess Master](https://geoguessmaster.com/).



## Geoguess Principle
1. GeoGuess is an open-source game
2. GeoGuess is free
3. GeoGuess is decentralized. Anyone can install their own game server without any dependence on this repository
4. GeoGuess keeps in mind to have an educational goal



This guide explains how to deploy your own GeoGuess server.
